## 📈 Task 1: Top Categories Analysis

### Objective
Compare the average user rating and total review counts of the top 10 app categories (ranked by total installations) under strict business requirements and filtering rules.

### Filters Applied
* **Rating**: $\ge$ 4.0
* **Size**: $\ge$ 10 MB (converts the size text to megabytes, filtering out smaller apps)
* **Last Updated**: Month of update must be January (e.g., `df["Last Updated"].dt.month == 1`)

### Visualization Used
An interactive grouped chart featuring a dual y-axis:
* **Primary Y-Axis (Left)**: Average Rating (represented as blue bars, ranging from 0 to 4.5).
* **Secondary Y-Axis (Right)**: Total Reviews (represented as a red line trace, ranging from 0 to 4.5 million).
* **Scheduling Restriction**: The visualization is timezone-aware and only executes between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM IST.

![Task 1 Chart](tasks/Task_1/task1_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Highest Engagement**: The `FAMILY` category accumulated by far the highest number of reviews (~4.54 million), demonstrating exceptionally high user interaction under these conditions.
* **Top Ratings**: `PERSONALIZATION` achieved the highest average rating of **4.47**, followed closely by `FAMILY` (4.40) and `EDUCATION` (4.40).
* **Lowest Ratings**: `PHOTOGRAPHY` recorded the lowest average rating (**4.15**) among the top 10 categories.
* **Review Disparity**: Categories like `SHOPPING` and `TOOLS` showed very low review totals under these filters, despite having high overall install volumes.

---

## 🌍 Task 2: Interactive Choropleth Map

### Objective
Create an interactive choropleth map using Plotly to visualize app installations across representative countries for the top 5 app categories under specific filtering criteria.

### Filters Applied
* **Category Exclusions**: Excludes categories starting with the letters `A`, `C`, `G`, or `S` (e.g., `ART_AND_DESIGN`, `COMMUNICATION`, `GAME`, `SHOPPING`, etc.).
* **Installation Threshold**: Only includes categories with total installs greater than 1,000,000.
* **Top Categories**: Selects the top 5 categories based on total installs after applying the above exclusions.

### Country Assignment (Assumptions)
Since the original dataset does not contain geographical information, representative countries were mapped as follows for visualization purposes:
* **PRODUCTIVITY** $\rightarrow$ United States (14.18B Installs)
* **TOOLS** $\rightarrow$ Canada (11.45B Installs)
* **FAMILY** $\rightarrow$ India (10.26B Installs)
* **PHOTOGRAPHY** $\rightarrow$ Australia (10.09B Installs)
* **NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES** $\rightarrow$ Germany (7.50B Installs)

### Visualization Used
An interactive global Plotly Choropleth map using the Viridis color scale.
* **Scheduling Restriction**: The visualization is timezone-aware and only executes between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM IST.

![Task 2 Chart](tasks/Task_2/task2_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Productivity Dominance**: The `PRODUCTIVITY` category (mapped to the US) recorded the highest volume of installs under these rules, exceeding 14 billion.
* **Category Focus**: Excluding gaming and social categories shifts the focus to utility-focused applications (Tools, Productivity, and Photography) which account for massive volumes of installations.
* **Legacy Distribution**: Even with strict alphabetical exclusions, categories like `FAMILY` and `NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES` remain highly relevant.

## 📊 Task 3: Dual-Axis Category Analysis (Installs vs. Revenue)

### Objective
Compare the average installations and estimated revenue for the top 3 categories of paid applications under strict business filtering rules.

### Filters Applied
* **Min Installations**: $\ge$ 10,000
* **Content Rating**: Target rating must be `Everyone`
* **App Name Length**: App name must not exceed 30 characters
* **Application Size**: App size must be greater than 15 MB
* **Estimated Revenue**: Revenue must be $\ge$ $10,000. (Since Revenue = Price $\times$ Installs, this implicitly excludes all Free apps, focusing only on Paid apps).

### Visualization Used
A grouped dual-axis chart comparing installations and revenue side-by-side:
* **Primary Y-Axis (Left)**: Average installations represented as a steel blue bar chart.
* **Secondary Y-Axis (Right)**: Total estimated revenue represented as a red line trace with marker points.
* **Scheduling Restriction**: Time-gated to execute and render only between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM IST.

![Task 3 Chart](tasks/Task_3/task3_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Photography Revenue Leader**: The `PHOTOGRAPHY` category generated the highest total estimated revenue (~$5.99 million) with an average of 1,000,000 installations per app.
* **Family Installs & Revenue**: The `FAMILY` category generated ~$796,900 in revenue with an average of ~381,429 installations.
* **Personalization Performance**: `PERSONALIZATION` generated ~$666,633 in revenue with an average of 670,000 installations.
* **Exclusion of Free Apps**: Due to the minimum revenue filter, all Free apps (which make up the majority of the Play Store) were excluded, showing the performance of high-value paid apps.
---

## 📈 Task 4: Time Series Analysis of Total Installs

### Objective
Examine the month-over-month trend and growth of total installations for specific app categories using a professional time-series visualization.

### Filters Applied
* **Reviews**: App reviews count must be > 500.
* **App Name Exclusions**: App names should not start with `X`, `Y`, or `Z`.
* **App Name Character Filter**: App names should not contain the letter `S` (case-insensitive).
* **Category Filter**: Category must begin with the letters `B`, `C`, or `E`.

### Category Translations
Translations were applied to show localized names on the chart:
* **BEAUTY** $\rightarrow$ `सौंदर्य` (Hindi)
* **BUSINESS** $\rightarrow$ `வணிகம்` (Tamil)
* **DATING** $\rightarrow$ `Dating` (German)
* *Note: The Dating category is not visible because it starts with 'D' and was filtered out by the B, C, E prefix rule.*

### Visualization Used
An interactive Plotly time-series line chart with markers, mapping total installs by month for each qualifying category.
* **Growth Highlighting**: Points showing month-over-month installation growth of $>20\%$ are marked with distinct icons or callouts.
* **Scheduling Restriction**: The visualization is timezone-aware and only executes between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM IST.

![Task 4 Chart](tasks/Task_4/task4_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Communication Leader**: The `COMMUNICATION` category recorded the highest volume of total installations across all months.
* **Growth Fluctuations**: Significant month-over-month spikes ($>20\%$) occurred in multiple categories, highlighting periods of increased consumer demand or user updates.
* **Filter Impact**: Restricting name prefixes (excluding X, Y, Z, and S) significantly limited the number of active apps evaluated in each category.

---

## 🫧 Task 5: App Size vs. Average Rating Bubble Chart

### Objective
Analyze the relationship between application size (in MB) and average rating using a multi-dimensional bubble chart that integrates user sentiment subjectivity.

### Filters Applied
* **Rating**: $\ge 3.5$
* **Installs**: $> 50,000$
* **Reviews**: $> 500$
* **Categories**: `GAME`, `BEAUTY`, `BUSINESS`, `COMICS`, `COMMUNICATION`, `DATING`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `EVENTS`, `SOCIAL`.
* **App Name Filter**: App name must not contain the letter `S` (case-insensitive).
* **Sentiment Subjectivity**: Average sentiment subjectivity of the app reviews must be $> 0.5$ (calculated by merging with the `User Reviews` dataset).

### Category Translations & Styling
* **BEAUTY** $\rightarrow$ `सौंदर्य` (Hindi)
* **BUSINESS** $\rightarrow$ `வணிகம்` (Tamil)
* **DATING** $\rightarrow$ `Dating` (German)
* **Color Customization**: The `GAME` category is specifically highlighted in Pink (`#FF69B4`). Other categories are mapped to standard scales.

### Visualization Used
An interactive Plotly bubble chart:
* **X-Axis**: App Size (in MB).
* **Y-Axis**: Average user rating.
* **Bubble Size**: Proportional to the total number of installations.
* **Color**: Represents the category.
* **Scheduling Restriction**: Timezone-aware check that only displays/renders between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM IST.

![Task 5 Chart](tasks/Task_5/task5_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Game Dominance**: The `GAME` category (highlighted in pink) contains the highest density of qualifying applications.
* **Weak Size-Rating Correlation**: Application size (MB) is weakly correlated with user ratings; both small and large apps achieve high ratings.
* **User Sentiment**: Filtering for subjectivity $>0.5$ shifts the dataset towards apps with more subjective, emotional reviews.
* **Condition Exclusions**: No apps in the `BEAUTY`, `COMICS`, or `EVENTS` categories satisfied all strict constraints (e.g. installs $>50k$ and subjectivity $>0.5$), excluding them from the bubble plot.

---

## 📈 Task 6: Cumulative Installs Stacked Area Chart

### Objective
Visualize the monthly cumulative installations over time for specific app categories, highlighting key growth periods and translating category names.

### Filters Applied
* **Rating**: $\ge 4.2$
* **App Name Exclusions**: App names should not contain any numeric digits (e.g. no numbers).
* **Category Prefixes**: Category must begin with the letters `T` or `P` (e.g., `TOOLS`, `TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL`, `PERSONALIZATION`, `PRODUCTIVITY`, `PARENTING`).
* **Reviews**: App reviews count must be $> 1000$.
* **Application Size**: App size must be between 20 MB and 80 MB.

### Category Translations
Category names were translated into target languages:
* **Travel & Local** $\rightarrow$ `Voyage et Local` (French)
* **Productivity** $\rightarrow$ `Productividad` (Spanish)
* **Photography** $\rightarrow$ `写真` (Japanese)
* *Note: Photography (写真) starts with 'P' and is included. Travel & Local starts with 'T' and is included. Productivity starts with 'P' and is included.*

### Visualization Used
An interactive Plotly stacked area chart displaying the cumulative sum of installs by month for each translated category.
* **MoM Growth Highlighting**: Points showing month-over-month growth exceeding $25\%$ are highlighted with visible visual indicators on the chart.
* **Scheduling Restriction**: The visualization is timezone-aware and only executes and displays between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM IST.

![Task 6 Chart](tasks/Task_6/task6_chart.png)

### Key Insights
* **Productivity Surge**: The Spanish-translated `Productividad` category represents the largest cumulative installations under these constraints, reaching over 1.7 billion installations by August 2018.
* **Photography Growth**: The Japanese-translated `写真` category accumulated over 691 million installations by August 2018, exhibiting multiple high-growth months.
* **Parenting and Personalization**: `PARENTING` and `PERSONALIZATION` categories maintain steady but smaller cumulative volumes under these constraints.
* **Identified Growth Points**: Multiple month-over-month growth spikes ($>25\%$) were successfully detected and highlighted, such as `Productividad` in June 2018 ($14,900\%$ growth) and `Voyage et Local` in April 2018 ($9,900\%$ growth).
